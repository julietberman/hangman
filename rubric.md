## Technical Requirements
Performing - App meets all technical requirements has great abstraction. Try taking on an object oriented approach!

## Code Quality
Performing/Excelling - Really great commenting, very clear documentation of what your code doing. Additionally a great readme to boot. Code could use some indentation formatting, but beyond that, great work!

## Creativity/Interface
Performing/Excelling - It's the small things. I love that the timer turns red after 15 seconds. The chalkboard theme is dope. They keyboard was definitely unique as it takes away options as you choose them.
